There are current three sets of Java APIs for graphics programming:
 AWT (Abstract Windowing Toolkit), Swing and JavaFX.

--> The java.awt package contains the core AWT graphics classes:
GUI Component classes, such as Button, TextField, and Label.
GUI Container classes, such as Frame and Panel.
Layout managers, such as FlowLayout, BorderLayout and GridLayout.
Custom graphics classes, such as Graphics, Color and Font.

--> The java.awt.event package supports event handling:
Event classes, such as ActionEvent, MouseEvent, KeyEvent and WindowEvent,
Event Listener Interfaces, such as ActionListener, MouseListener, MouseMotionListener, KeyListener and WindowListener,
Event Listener Adapter classes, such as MouseAdapter, KeyAdapter, and WindowAdapter.
